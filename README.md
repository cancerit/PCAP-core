This repository contains code to run genomic alignments of paired end data
and subsequent calling algorithms.

The intention is to provide reference implementations and simple to execute wrappers
that are useful for the scientific community who may have little IT/bioinformatic support.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAP-core/wiki) for further details.
