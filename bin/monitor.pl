JOB SUMMARY
---------------------
Wall sec.    : %d
Time sec.    : %d
User sec.    : %d
System sec.  : %d
Peak Res GB  : %.2f
Peak Virt GB : %.2f

Time, User and System are a total of the time taken by all processes in each state.
Memory is peak based on sampling of all memory in use at 1 second intervals.
OUTFORMAT
